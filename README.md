# Smart Healthcare Expense & Disease Prediction System (Machine Learning Project)

This project is a **Machine Learning-based healthcare prediction system** that analyzes patient data to:
1) Predict disease risk using **classification models**
2) Estimate healthcare expenses using **regression models**
3) Provide **lifestyle improvement suggestions** based on data insights

The system is purely data-driven and operates on structured patient datasets. No hardware or IoT components are involved.

## 🧠 Core Functionalities
| Module | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Disease Prediction** | Classifies risk of common diseases based on patient data. | Disease Risk Level (Low/Medium/High) |
| **Expense Estimation** | Predicts expected medical cost using regression models. | Estimated Healthcare Expense (₹ / $) |
| **Lifestyle Suggestions** | Provides personalized guidance to reduce health risk. | Diet, Exercise & Habit Recommendations |
